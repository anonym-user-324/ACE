"On 2025-01-25, how can I have Git overwrite (not merge) all changed files from another branch?","On 2025-01-25, to have Git overwrite (not merge) all changed files from another branch, you should do a `git checkout -B main feature` as suggested in the evidence. However, for overwriting changes, you might need to manually stage and force push your changes, which could lead to data loss if not handled carefully. The command `git checkout -B main feature` creates a new branch named `main` based on the `feature` branch, effectively replacing the content of `main` with the `feature` branch's content. If you want to forcefully overwrite `main` without any merge conflicts, you would need to ensure no local changes are staged and then use `git checkout -f main && git reset --hard HEAD`. Remember, this action is irreversible and will discard any uncommitted changes in your working directory.","ace-79386139,ace-79394861,ace-79325205,ace-79327256,ace-79329910",,,,"[ace-79386139] Q: Have git overwrite NOT MERGE all changed files from other branch

A: Good question. I am doing the Certification study for Databricks as it so happens. They seem at odds. Short answer to your question is YES. Why? ZORDER as in %sql OPTIMIZE delta./mnt/delta/t1 ZORDER BY (c1, c2) is essentially clustering to speed up filter, where operations. Auto Compaction, when enabled, is about making fewer, larger files from smaller files to improve performance - small files problems. That will be done without being cognisant of ZORDER. Thus breaking the ZORDER aspects achieved. NB: I read also that it is most applicable for Structured Streaming.

[ace-79555982] Q: Basic implementation of AspectJ not working I have written a simple module in IntelliJ (Java 11 + Maven 3.6) to test AspectJ functionality. However, the Aspects are not working as expected. Can someone tell what I am doing wrong?
A: First, I had to fix the problems in your sample: Remove the parent declaration from the POM and add its version number to the module. Add the missing double quote in String name = ""Test; . Use JoinPoint in your @Before advice instead of ProceedingJoinPoint, which is only allowed in @Around advices. Now, the application compiles both in Maven and in IntelliJ IDEA. When running it, the aspect also gets applied.

"In March 2025, Calculate the gradient with respect to attention but also the FFN layers for a pre-trained LLMs, what was the issue and proposed solution?","The issue mentioned in the March 2025 event was related to calculating gradients with respect to specific layers and the FFN layer in the Transformer architecture of pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, the user asked if it was possible to return the gradient with respect to specific layers and the FFN layer in the Transformer architecture of pre-trained LLMs from the hugging-face model. 

However, the evidence suggests that it is not possible to directly calculate these gradients. The response indicates that the approach described is not applicable to the scenario presented. Instead, the evidence points to the original paper suggesting that in Grad-CAM, the gradient is backpropagated until the last convolutional layer, unlike saliency maps which backpropagate the gradient until the input.

There is no proposed solution provided in the evidence, as the issue itself was acknowledged as non-possible based on current methods and techniques.","ace-79501263,ace-79478858,ace-79479822,ace-79481710,ace-79482613",,,,"[ace-79501263] Q: Calculate the gradient with respect to attention but also the FFN layers for a pre-trained LLMs I would like to return the gradient with respect to specific layers and the FFN layer in the Transformer architecture of pre-trained LLMs from the hugging-face model.

"In March 2025, how did we assign a variable to an output in Java?","In March 2025, to assign an output to a variable in Java, you would typically store the result of a method call or an expression into a variable. For example, if you have a method `calculateResult()` that returns a value, you could assign its return value to a variable like this:

```java
int result = calculateResult();
```

This line of code assigns the value returned by the `calculateResult()` method to the variable `result`. If the method call involves multiple steps or operations, you might need to chain them together or use intermediate variables to manage the flow of data.

The previous evidence suggests dealing with Java by addressing repetitive code and storing outputs for future use, which aligns with the concept of assigning an output to a variable.","ace-79482464,ace-79478463,ace-79478507,ace-79487293,ace-79503093",,,,"[ace-79482464] Q: How can I assign a variable to an output in java?

[ace-79322545] Q: Will this lead to null pointer dereference? In the following code, a SomeClass object is scoped inside a block but a reference to it is stored in p in an outer block. And later using p, SomeMethod() of SomeClass is called. SomeClass TestMethod(SomeClass c) { SomeClass * p; { SomeClass t; p = &t; } p->SomeMethod(); return *p; } Will p->SomeMethod() fault due to a null pointer dereference?
A: No, this will not necessarily lead to a null pointer dereference. p was assigned some non-null value within the block. Just because the thing it points at has ended its lifetime doesn't mean the value (pointer value) stored in p will become nullptr magically. However, this is still undefined behavior if SomeMethod is a non-static method, because (assuming SomeClass is a class type - heavily implied) the lifetime of t ends at the end of the block.

We are using distributed cache to share users authentication, sessions, data protection keys etc. between the pods. It all works fine for about a day, but then suddenly the user request start to fail due to invalid antiforgery tokens, users get signed out. It looks like the pods for some reason swap dataprotection key from the one in distributed cache to the local one. We added logging to see which key is used by the pod and the one that is logged couldn't be found in the cache. The pods didn't crash or restart itself in the meanwhile.

[ace-79483821] Q: Ag-grid to continue scrolling till rowCount = undefined is being passed I am using ag-grid-react server-side source model in my application. I am setting cacheBlockSize = 40, and defining a custom datasource to be used in getRows() function. I need to call 4 APIs in the datasource and the APIs are paginated. So I am requesting 10 records from each API to make up block size of 40. Now the problem I am running into is - I would like to keep calling the APIs until I know that data is exhausted. That means until every call returns less than 10 records, I would like ag-grid to trigger getRows(). But the moment, I receive less than 10 records from any one of the call, my resulting dataSize that I set in success callback becomes less than 40 (block size). Even though I am passing rowCount = undefined, the getRows() is not being triggered again. I am assuming this is due to ag grid stopping further calls because it got blockSize less than 40, so considering it as last block. Can I get any workaround to solve this?

[ace-79639987] Q: How to implement Apple RoomPlan API in a React Native iOS app using native module bridging?
A: I'm trying to integrate Apple's RoomPlan API into my React Native iOS app. Since RoomPlan is available only in Swift (iOS 16+), I'm using native module bridging to make it work with React Native. Here's what I’ve done so far: Created a new Swift file and enabled Swift compatibility in my React Native iOS project. Created a custom native module named RoomPlanIOS using @objc and RCTBridgeModule. Configured bridging headers correctly. IOS app crashed on startRoomCapture to JavaScript. I created a Swift native module for RoomPlan and exposed a method to start the room capture session using RoomCaptureView. I expected the RoomPlan UI to appear and start scanning when I called this method from React Native. However, nothing happens—no UI is shown, and no delegate methods are triggered.

"In January 2025, how do you select all files with a certain postfix (e.g., *.gz) across all subdirectories?","To select all files with a certain postfix, such as *.gz, across all subdirectories in a specified directory, you can use the `rsync` command as previously discussed. Here's the command again for clarity:

```

This command will recursively search through the `/source/` directory and its subdirectories, including only files with the `.gz` postfix, and exclude other files. The `-a` flag preserves file attributes, `-v` provides verbose output, and `-P` enables progress reporting. 

The `--include='*/'` option ensures that directories are included, and `--include='*.gz'` specifies that only files with the `.gz` extension should be included.

[ace-79333050] Q: Docker : How to access base image environment variables at build time I am building a Docker image from the OCaml image ocaml/opam:debian-12-ocaml-5.2. During build phase, I need to access the env variable OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX which is defined to be /home/opam/.opam/5.2 in the base image above. However, it seems it is not accessible to the commands in my Dockerfile. Any idea why is that and how to fix it (I would preferably not hard code the variable in my Dockerfile nor have to pass it each time with -build-arg ?
A: When the user's Dockerfile runs commands (e.g., RUN opam ...), these commands are executed in a new shell session within the container during the build process. While the base image sets the environment variable, this setting doesn't automatically persist across all subsequent RUN instructions in the Dockerfile. Each RUN instruction starts a fresh shell, so the variable isn't automatically inherited. You can use ENV instruction inside Dockerfile. The ENV instruction sets environment variables that persist across all subsequent RUN instructions within the Dockerfile.

"In March 2025, how was sorting objects by a date stored as a string followed by a secondary field resolved?","In March 2025, the resolution for sorting objects by a date stored as a string followed by a secondary string field was demonstrated through an example code snippet. The approach used was to utilize Java Streams and the Comparator interface to sort the list of products. Specifically, the solution involved creating a comparator that first sorts by the production date (converted from a string to a date), and then by the production country. Here's a breakdown of the provided solution:

```java
List<Product> sortedProduct = productList.stream()
    .sorted(Comparator.comparing(Product::getProductionDate)
        .thenComparing(Product::getProductionCountry))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

This code effectively sorts the `productList` based on the `productionDate` field, treating it as a date even though it's stored as a string, and then by the `productionCountry` field. The `Comparator.comparing()` method is used to compare elements based on their `productionDate`, and `thenComparing()` is used to apply another comparison based on `productionCountry`. 

The evidence suggests that ideally, one should refactor the database to use appropriate data types for storing dates, but in this specific scenario, the provided solution demonstrates a practical workaround using Java Streams.","ace-79485236,ace-79543512,ace-79485924,ace-79488329,ace-79499249",,,,"[ace-79485236] Q: How to sort a list of object by two fields when the first field is a date but of string type and the second field is a plain string?

[ace-79543512] Q: Custom sorting a single string I have a list of five-character strings, each string representing a hand of five playing cards.

I can sort a numeric five character string using:  def sort_string(s): return ''.join(sorted(s)) print(sort_string(""21437""))  But how to sort a string with numbers and letters?

[ace-79482166] Q: User Permission List for PowerBI I have a Workspace with a number of different Semantic Models and Reports branching off of them. This was done so similar data can be restricted from some Semantic Models and still allow users to build upon the data set. For example, I do not want my inventory team being able to view the values of items, or the outstanding amount due to a supplier. It can get unwieldy trying to figure out who has access to what reports and models and I cannot find a way to visualize this. Does anyone know how to do this? Does anyone have a suggestion for a better way of solving this issue? I know about row-level security, but this is not just row-level data... this is hiding entire columns. Ideally I would like to use the same report and just have some users able to see columns that other users have no access to, without any kind of errors.

[ace-79405891] Q: How is the state of Android Studio for ARM Linux? ADB for ARM needed? I have a Ubuntu 24.04 arm on a UTM VM. I could not launch Android Studio, it gets glitchy probably due to the OpenGL acceleration I'm using. However I was able to launch Intellij IDEA which supports Wayland. IDEA can create an Android project and with SSH forwarding I can get it to display a target from an emulator from a second machine, on Android Device Manager in the IDEA. Howerver, I cannot run my app, it says: No target device found When inspeting the notifications of IDEA ""could not determine adb version"" I believe this is because Android SDK contains adb for x64 only.

Summarize the advice given about why CPU efficiency cores exhibit lower core-to-core latency than performance cores around April 2025.,"Based on the information from the relevant past event, Intel's efficiency cores (E-cores) in their CPU architecture are organized into clusters of four cores that share an L2 cache. The coherency mechanism is optimized such that within these local L2 caches, communication between cores remains efficient, contributing to lower core-to-core latency compared to performance cores. This optimization allows for better performance and efficiency in workloads where local data access is frequent.","ace-79581985,ace-79550675,ace-79550367,ace-79550752,ace-79560587",,,,"[ace-79581985] Q: Why does my CPU's efficiency core have a lower core-to-core latency?

[ace-79550367] Q: Snakemake in cluster different ways When running snakemake on a cluster, and if we don't have specific requirements for some rules about number of cores/memory, then what is the difference between : Using the classic way, i.e. calling snakemake on the login node, telling it that executor is slurm and that we want X jobs with X cores each, optionally with a profile config file (1 job = 1 rule) Using snakemake like a normal tool, and call it with srun inside a sbatch script without telling it that this is a slurm environment (1 job = whole pipeline)
A: With the second way, your whole workflow will have to wait in the queue before individual rule instances can start. With the first way the resource demand will be spread across the jobs that snakemake will submit, so each rule has a chance to start earlier than what you would have to wait in the second way.

"In May 2025, summarize the situation with resolving static typing issues in Python without using casts or ignored type checks.","In May 2025, there were discussions about resolving static typing issues in Python without using casts or ignored type checks. One common issue discussed was the inability of a static analyzer to determine the exact type of a variable when dealing with inheritance or unions, leading to warnings like ""no return annotation found"". To address this, one suggestion was to use explicit casting (`cast`) to provide more information to the static type checker. Another approach mentioned was to use `TypeVar` from the typing module to define a mapping that reflects the relationship between types, which can help in making the type checker happier. Additionally, some users expressed doubt about whether it's possible to completely resolve these issues without using casts or ignoring type checks, suggesting that the current type hint system might be too conservative in its assumptions.","ace-79626900,ace-79604354,ace-79614547,ace-79618803,ace-79625827",,,,"[ace-79626900] Q: How to fix the problem without using assert isinstance or typing.cast, or even without the # type: ignore comment?
A: Type analysis is inherently conservative. As pointed out in the replies, you're declaring the container as a Parent1 container, so a static analyzer does not know whether child1 is a Child1 or a Child2 since it can't actually run the code.

Then start it again once you go back to the page that should be running it. Another option is to put the timer in the UI page so that when a navigation triggers you can start/stop it there.
